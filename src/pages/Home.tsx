              Hi, and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Elsa, and my journey
              into web development began with my previous studies in Information
              Design, specializing in Spatial Design. This experience ignited my
              curiosity to explore the digital world, including its virtual
              spaces and the processes involved in building them. In 2023, I
              pursued this interest further and enrolled in the Web
              Developmentâ€”E-commerce program at Medieinstituet in Stockholm.
              That's where I am right now, enjoying the continued journey of
              learning to code.
